## Python01

its actually the first project i started, although it probably wont get anywhere. Written in python, its my first attempt at coding. While not well organised or even well coded, it gets the job done, as in it works. Will improve on this project, and maybe even completly revamp the messy code.

## Java01

my first attempt at Java. just a couple of files with random tests. Again, expect bad code here since i still have no idea how object oriented programming works(although am figuring out). I will eventually begin a couple of projects on Java, not sure what tho.
