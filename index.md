## Python01

its actually the first project i started, although it probably wont get anywhere. Written in python, its my first attempt at coding. While not well organised or even well coded, it gets the job done, as in it works. Will improve on this project, and maybe even completly revamp the messy code.

please inform me if u have any suggestions or critisicm. All criticism is welcome. Repository: (https://github.com/cygnus-dev/python01)
```
async def run(ctx):
    random_index = randint(1, 100)
    luck = random_index
    unlucky_msg = "Too bad, landed sideways :("
    lucky_msg = "landed the right way up! very cool!"

    def bottle__flip():
        if luck > 15:
            return unlucky_msg
        else:
            return lucky_msg

    await ctx.send(bottle__flip())

```

## Java1

my first attempt at Java. just a couple of files with random tests. Again, expect bad code here since i still have no idea how object oriented programming works(although am figuring out). I will eventually begin a couple of projects on Java, not sure what tho.

Again, critism welcome. Repository: (https://github.com/cygnus-dev/Java1)
